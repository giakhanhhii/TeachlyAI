```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and setup

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo>

# Install git pre-push hook (required, run once)
bash scripts/setup_hooks.sh
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. The `AI_LOG_*` variables are pre-filled.

### 3. Run

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # Linux/Mac
# or: venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m src.agent
```

## Weekly Journal

Update **[JOURNAL.md](./JOURNAL.md)** at the end of every week to document your product-building journey:

- Features shipped
- AI tools used and how they helped
- Hardest problem of the week and how you solved it
- What you'd do differently
- Plan for next week

> JOURNAL.md **must be updated** before each PR. It is your learning record for the course.

## Worklog

Update **[WORKLOG.md](./WORKLOG.md)** whenever your team makes a technical decision or changes direction:

- **Technical decisions** — why did you choose this approach over alternatives?
- **Task assignments** — who does what, by when
- **Brainstorming** — options considered, pros/cons, conclusion
- **Important bugs** — root cause and fix

See each file for the format and examples.

## AI Logging

Prompts and tool calls are **automatically logged** when you use any supported AI tool (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini, Copilot). No manual steps needed after running `setup_hooks.sh`.

## Development Testing

Week 1 tooling adds a local safety net without changing runtime behavior.

### Python backend tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest tests/backend -q
```

### Front-end tooling

```bash
npm install
npm run lint
npm run test:unit
```

### Playwright smoke tests

Install Chromium only for the lightest setup:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:e2e
```
